# snake-hardware
For this project, my partner and I, created an enhanced version of the snake game on verilog from scratch using VGA, with keyboard imports. These are some of the charecteristics of the game:
1) 2-Player snake functionality
2) Random moving for the moving fruit
3) Randomly generated spawn of static and moving fruit
4) Keyboard input functionality
5) Horizontal and vertical moving obstacles that the snake must avoid

Note: The vga_related_modules and keyboard_related_modules are not our work, but provided to us through class and online resources

# Build Notes:
In order to run the snake game, you will need a FPGA connection with VGA plugin. You will also need to connect a PS2 Keyboard to the FPGA. Import all of the modules in the files into the main.v file (or you can copy-paste all of the code in the seperate files into the main.v file) and then compile and run the main.v module using Quartus Prime Software.
