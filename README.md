# snake-hardware
For this project, my partner and I, created an enhanced version of the snake game on verilog from scratch using VGA, with keyboard imports. These are some of the charecteristics of the game:
1) 2-Player snake functionality
2) Random moving for the moving fruit
3) Randomly generated spawn of static and moving fruit
4) Keyboard input functionality
5) Horizontal and vertical moving obstacles that the snake must avoid

Note: The vga_related_modules and keyboard_related_modules are not our work, but provided to us through class and online resources
